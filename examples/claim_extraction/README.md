# Claim Extraction Helper Example

This example shows the optional claim extraction helper introduced for the
`v0.4.0` line.

The helper is deterministic. It does not call an LLM and does not verify truth.
It only converts user-provided claim-like items into structured
AgentClaimGuard `Claim` objects.

```text
LLM/RAG answer -> claim candidates -> AgentClaimGuard.verify(...)
```

## Run

```bash
python examples/claim_extraction/demo.py
```

## Expected Output

```text
extracted_claims=1
skipped_items=1
guard_status=blocked
claim_status=tool_required
safe_verdict=insufficient_evidence
```

## Boundary

Extraction is not verification.

Use `ClaimExtractionTemplate.default()` when you want to ask your own LLM to
produce claim candidates. AgentClaimGuard still verifies those claims against
evidence, tool results, and policies afterwards.
